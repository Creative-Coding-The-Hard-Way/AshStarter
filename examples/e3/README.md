# Swapchain

This example shows a GLFW application which creates a Swapchain to clear the
screen every frame.

The swapchain is automatically rebuilt when the window is resized or when it
becomes invalid for any reason.

## Usage

```
cargo run --example e3
```

## Keybinds

* `Esc` - exit
* `Space + Ctrl` - toggle fullscreen
